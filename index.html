                <h2>Project Descriptions</h2>
                <h3>Intro to HTML</h3>
                <p>Students will learn the names and uses of important HTML tags and how they are used to give basic structure to a website. We will discuss the basic skeleton of an HTML document and the necessary code to get started. Students will learn the tags and syntax to appropriately display text, links, lists, and images on a website. We will walk through, as a class, creating a basic HTML document using the courseâ€™s syllabus for content. If time permits, students will participate in creating an HTML website for their section of the class as practice.</p>
                <h3>Intro CSS</h3>
                <p>Students will learn the basics of CSS syntax and the differences between classes and ID identifiers.  Students will learn common CSS properties and visually see how these properties affect HTML objects they are applied to. We will discuss specificity and the cascade of the style sheet and how it pertains to styling objects in HTML. CSS will be used to create typographic hierarchy as well as structure the basic graphical layout of the created HTML pages from the previous class.</p>
                <h3>Tools &amp; Services</h3>
                <p>Students will be shown commonly used tools and services such as text editors and web services as well as how to use these tools. We will discuss the common HTML and CSS framework Bootstrap and how students can use it to quickly start developing websites. Continued discussion on CSS and grid layouts.Students will learn how to set up basic web hosting in order to get their websites to run live on the internet. Students will also create a github account and get a website running quickly online.</p>
                <h3>Document Layouts and Outlines</h3>
                <p>Students will learn how to create a basic text document that illustrates the basic informational hierarchy of a website. Students will participate in creating a document layout of a pre-existing website as a class. The layout of the website will be redesigned using this document outline as a base and then creating this new website using basic HTML and CSS will be demonstrated. Students will create a basic document outline of their own chosen website for use as a final project.</p>
                <h3>Website Recreation</h3>
                <p>Students will use their created document outlines to create a basic design of their website using photoshop, sketch, or their own preferred layout tool that has been shared with the class. Students will work on using this design and document outline to code the HTML and CSS needed to create their own version of their chosen site.</p>
                <h3>Website Recreation Work and Review</h3>
                <p>Students will finish their website re-creation project and demonstrate it to the class. We will discuss any questions or problems encountered during the creation and how they could be solved. We will discuss how to continue developing skills and interest in the web design and development field.</p>
