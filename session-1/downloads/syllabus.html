Students will learn common CSS properties and visually see how these properties affect the HTML objects they are applied to. We will discuss specificity and the cascade of the style sheet and how it pertains to styling objects in HTML. CSS will be used to create typographic hierarchy as well as structure the basic graphical layout of the created HTML website from the previous class.</p>
                <h3>Tools &amp; Services</h3>
                <p>Students will be shown commonly used tools and services such as text edi- tors and web services as well as how to use these tools.

                <p>Students will learn how to create a basic text document that illustrates the basic informational hierarchy of a website. Students will participate in creating a document layout of a pre-existing website as a class. This document will be used towards translating the website on their own using HTML + CSS.</p>
                <h3>Website Recreation</h3>
                <p>Students will use their created document outlines to create a basic design of their website, effectively translating from the web, to paper, and back to the web.
